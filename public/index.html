  <h1>Short URLs</h1>
  <p>This is the domain for my short URLs. You may find links similar to <a href="https://byjp.fyi/me">byjp.fyi/me</a>, they come here and will redirect you to the (likely more complicated) URL I intended.</p>
  <p>I run this domain myself so that the redirect destinations are public, and will remain accessible, even as links rot. It's powered by <a href="https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0002/"></a>IPFS _redirects</a>, you can see the full list of redirects at <a href="https://byjp.fyi/_redirects">byjp.fyi/_redirects</a> any time.</p>
